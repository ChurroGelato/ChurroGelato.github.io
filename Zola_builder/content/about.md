My name is Matheus Ribeiro Vidal. I was born in Brasília, Brasil and now live in Munich, Germany.

I studied mechanical engineering at the [University of Brasília (UnB)](https://unb.br/) and graduated in 2023. [This was my Thesis](/projects/pg2).

I am now studying Computational Mechanics at the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/).

My interests range from CAE, CFD and Open Source software to pagode, beach volleyball, watching football (like my dad, I’m a big fan of [Fluminense](https://www.instagram.com/fluminensefc?igsh=eXBiaGlyN2RuZnJr)), boardgames, [cooking](/recipes), travelling, reading and enjoying family life.

In my [/now](/now) page you can see what I'm up to nowadays.

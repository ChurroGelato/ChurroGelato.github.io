## Title (English)
Open Source Numerical Simulations of Turbulent Flow over Downforce Generating Multielement Wings in Ground Effect 

## Abstract (English)
This work tries to establish and validate a complete cycle of computational fluid dynamics simulations using open-source tools. The main objective is to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of using open-source tools to simulate complex fluid dynamic phenomena. To achieve this goal, the simulation cycle is established using the following programs: SALOME for mesh generation and pre-processing, SU2 for numerical calculations, and Paraview for results and data visualization. The chosen geometry for validating this simulation cycle is the geometry of the experiments in the doctoral thesis by Zerihan (2001), which consists of a Formula 1 car's front wing inside a wind tunnel. The case was modeled in CAD software, three dimensional meshes were generated, and simulations were conducted to compare the values of the dimensionless aerodynamic coefficients obtained with the literature. The methodology employed during the simulation cycle is described in detail, with justifications for decisions made and observations on the workflow in the programs used. The results of this work demonstrate a good capability to capture complex aerodynamic phenomena and establish a reliable approach for solving problems in computational fluid dynamics.

Thanks for dropping by!

If you want to know what I'm working on, check out my [/projects](./projects).

For blog posts, head to [/posts](./posts).
I'll write mostly in english or portuguese, but german or other languages may appear as well. I'll try to keep languages organized in the [/tags](./tags) section though.

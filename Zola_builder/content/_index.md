Thanks for dropping by!

This is my personal website, greatly inspired by <a href="https://rutar.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rutar's</a> and using the amazing <a href="https://www.getzola.org/themes/apollo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apollo template for zola</a> by <a href="https://github.com/not-matthias" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not-matthias</a>.

If you want to know what I'm working on, check out [my projects](./projects).

For blog posts, head to [/posts](./posts).
I'll write mostly in english or portuguese, but german or other languages may appear as well. I'll try to keep languages organized in the [tags](./tags) section though.

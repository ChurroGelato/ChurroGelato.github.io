Thanks for dropping by!

If you want to know my work, check out my [/projects](./projects).

For blog posts, head to [/posts](./posts).
I'll write mostly in English or Portuguese, but German or other languages may appear as well. I'll try to keep languages organized in the [/tags](./tags) section though.

If you want to contact me, you can find some ways to do so at the top of the page!

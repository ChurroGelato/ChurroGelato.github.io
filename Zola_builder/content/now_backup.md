This is my [Now section](https://nownownow.com/about) and if you have your own website, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/) too!

Nowadays, I am:

- Showing my parents around München and eagerly awaiting my Fiancé to visit me next month;
- Attending classes for the second semester of my degree at TUM;
- Studying [OpenFoam](https://openfoam.org/) by [trying to minimize the amount of shakes to my orange juice bottle during breakfast](/projects/oj);
- Working to finish the website for my wedding;
- Improving my German by playing as much beach volleyball with my german friends as my knees allow;
- Studying [Isogeometric Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isogeometric_analysis) for [a project at TUM](/projects/softwarelab);
- Practicing cavaquinho, my goal is to be able to play some samba and pagode songs in 6 months;
- Listening to a great deal of [Exaltasamba](https://open.spotify.com/track/6XFWri1vmFonMp5eHPY6K0?si=ff3272b46ed040ae) and [Turma do Pagode](https://open.spotify.com/track/6VmCuIpGrkTseUjRTaROnF?si=65926159a337446e);
- Testing some automation scripts for this website;

# Ingredients
- 2 cups of freshly grated coconut (1 coconut – about 200 g)
- 3 eggs
- 2 cups of sugar
- 1 tablespoon of melted butter
# Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 180 °C (moderate temperature). Grease a shallow baking dish that holds about 500 ml with butter.  
2. In a small bowl, crack one egg at a time and transfer each to a larger bowl — this way, if one is bad, you won’t ruin the recipe. Add the melted butter and mix with a whisk. Gradually add the sugar, stirring well after each addition. Add the grated coconut and fold it in with a spatula.  
3. Transfer the batter to the baking dish and bake for about 40 minutes, or until golden brown — the **cocada** will form a crispy crust but remain creamy in the center.  
4. Remove from the oven and let it cool to room temperature before serving. This **cocada** is also delicious served cold.
# Obs
Finely grated fresh coconut gives the **cocada** more flavor and creaminess — it even tastes a bit like _quindim_. Coarsely grated coconut (as well as the frozen grated version) adds a crunchy texture and a rustic look, but the egg and sugar custard doesn’t absorb the fruit’s flavor. Dried shredded coconut is not recommended for this recipe — the **cocada** turns out dry and bland.

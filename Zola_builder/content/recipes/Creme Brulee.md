# Ingredients
- 300 ml **Schlagsahne** (whipping cream)
- 4 **egg yolks**
- 60 g **Zucker** (sugar)
- 1 tsp **Vanilleextrakt** (or 1/2 vanilla pod)
- Extra sugar for the caramel top

# Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 160°C. Boil some water for a bain-marie.
2. Gently heat the Schlagsahne with the vanilla until just before boiling. Remove from heat and let infuse.
3. Whisk egg yolks and sugar until pale and creamy.
4. Slowly pour the warm cream into the egg mixture, whisking constantly to avoid curdling.
5. Strain the mixture and divide into ramekins.
6. Place ramekins in a deep baking dish, fill halfway with the hot water, and bake for 25–30 minutes — until just set with a slight wobble in the center.
7. Let them cool for 10 minutes, then chill in the **freezer for 30 min** and fridge for **30 more** before serving.
8. Just before serving, sprinkle a thin layer of sugar on top and caramelize it with a torch or under a hot grill.

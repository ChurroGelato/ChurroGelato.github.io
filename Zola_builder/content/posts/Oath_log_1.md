# Story

The land was divided. While half of it thrived under a structured dominion, the other half was at the mercy of independent factions of bandits. The Chancellor, always a patron of the arcane arts, founded a great school of magic in the Capital, a beacon of knowledge that gave the empire an unmatched advantage in discovering the world’s deepest secrets.

However, knowledge was not the Chancellor’s monopoly. In exile, a cunning leader in blue robes, guided by a seer of immense clairvoyant power, accumulated stolen secrets, rising quickly to rival the wisdom of the Empire. Meanwhile, the exiled warrior Yellow raised a stronghold in the Remote Lands, driving the bandits from the Salt Plains and laying the foundations of a new power. In contrast, Red, besieged by Blue’s relentless pursuit, saw the wisdom of its elders stolen, their legacy slipping through their fingers.

The Chancellor ruled the empire with diligence, but allowed the peripheral provinces to fall into chaos. Yellow’s expansion continued with the annexation of the Hidden Place, a refuge for alchemy and trade, while Red, desperate to escape Blue’s pursuit, took the Banner of the Darkest Secret and sought refuge among the seers in the Mines. And, in a twist of fate, Red was struck by a Vision of Faith, and the miners joined their cause. At the same time, Blue, banished to the Bandit Mountains by Yellow, had a Vision of Rebellion. With the accumulated knowledge, Blue traded favors and claimed the Banner of Popular Favor, becoming the voice of the discontented.

Despite Yellow’s growing power, the Chancellor saw a greater threat in Blue’s rise. In a masterful political maneuver, he left the religious fervor of Red for Yellow to handle and instead gathered his forces for a crushing attack on the Mountains. The battle was quick and relentless—the favor of Blue among the people unraveled, their influence in ruins. Fleeing to the capital, Blue sought to reignite support as the Chancellor, triumphant but exhausted, returned home.

Meanwhile, Yellow’s conquest of the Mines allowed him to seize the Darkest Secret from Red’s cultists. However, Red did not give up so easily. He recovered his sacred banner and, realizing the fleeting nature of his followers' faith, set off for the Salt Plains in search of untapped riches. The Chancellor’s march back from the Mountains led to an unexpected discovery—the entrance to the Hidden Place. Although his army was weary, nomadic archers, old allies of the empire, joined his cause, and the Hidden Place fell under imperial control.

Even after losing control of the Hidden Place, Yellow’s victories continued. In a crushing demonstration of power, he suppressed the growing faith of Red, further solidifying his reputation as an invincible force. Whispers of black magic and hypnotic rhythms spread, rumors of an immortal, resurrected army that bent all to its will. Yet, deep within the Mines, true believers still resisted. The Fire Speakers, prophets of the flames, joined Red’s cause, their conviction renewing their right to claim.

In the capital, Blue did not remain idle. Walking through the Roadside Inn and the Imperial Garrison, he stoked the flames of rebellion. An insurgent faction arose, naming him their leader, and in the heart of the empire, the people cried out for change. The Ancient City watched as Blue’s forces tried to invade the palace, with the people’s favor on his side.

But the Chancellor was no stranger to political tides. From the Rocky Coast, he watched the revolution unfold, knowing that his victories in distant lands could change the hearts of the people once more. Parading the spoils of war through the streets, he won over the masses, and Blue’s rebellion crumbled. The insurgents were eliminated, their movement dispersing like dust in the wind.

Having crushed the rebellion, the Chancellor returned to the Rocky Coast, where he encountered a Wandering Terror. Closing a deal, he sent the beast to the Salt Plains, the focal point of Yellow’s sphere of influence, hoping to weaken his domain. Meanwhile, Red’s faith burned stronger than ever. Deep within the Mines, he preached a new world—of coal and salt, of fire and renewal. Pilgrims and believers gathered in masses, seeking refuge in the labyrinthine tunnels, ready to forge their own destiny.

But faith alone would not protect them. Yellow, seeing Red’s rise, marched once again to extinguish the flame. This time, the result was different. No one had ever defeated Yellow in direct combat. No one, before Red in the Mines. The narrow tunnels became a furnace of resistance. The Fire Speakers and their fiery beasts turned the underground into a blazing hell. When the battle ended, only ashes and charred remains were left of Yellow’s once-invincible army.

The prophecy was fulfilled. As insurrection and revolution shook the empire, faith grew in the depths of the earth, forged in persecution and loss.

Alone, defeated, Yellow awaited his execution. However, Red, triumphant, extended his hand. Yellow was not to be punished— for there can be no persecuted without a persecutor. With no other choice, Yellow knelt, accepting his fate as a living witness to the undeniable triumph of faith over oppression.

And so, the empire fell. Whether due to insurrection or the inability to control the changing tides, its reign came to an end. The Ancient City, once the heart of the world, was abandoned as the masses moved to the Salt Plains and the Mines, seeking the one who spoke of renewal.

The palace, once a symbol of unshakable power, crumbled under the inexorable weight of history. In its place, a new order arose. A chancellor, chosen not by lineage, but by devotion...Thus began the era of the Flame.

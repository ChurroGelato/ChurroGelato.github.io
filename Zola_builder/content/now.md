This is my [Now section](https://nownownow.com/about) and if you have your own website, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/) too!

Nowadays, I am:

- Studying for the third semester of my masters program at TUM;
- I'm currently also working on 3 simultaneous projects at TUM:
	- Using [Isogeometric Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isogeometric_analysis) for [a lightweight python implementation of contact modelling](/projects/softwarelab);
	- Using [Large-Eddy Simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_eddy_simulation) for [the validation of SIGMA modelling of SGS stresses in MGLET](/projects/hydromechanicstum);
	- Using [Structural Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_dynamics) for [investigating the self-excited oscillations leading to brake noise](/projects/strukturdynamiktumbmw) with [BMW](https://www.bmw.com/en/index.html);
- Playing cavaquinho and reco-reco in a _roda de samba_ with brazilian friends.
	- I'm thinking of maybe getting myself a banjo sometime soon too...
- Swimming, running, playing beach volleyball and padel as much as I can.

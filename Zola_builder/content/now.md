This is my [Now section](https://nownownow.com/about) and if you have your own website, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/) too!

Nowadays, I am:

- Eagerly awaiting my fiancé and my parents to visit me in the next month;
- Studying [OpenFoam](https://openfoam.org/) by [trying to minimize the amount of shakes to my OJ bottle during breakfast](/projects/oj);
- Working to finish the website for my wedding;
- Improving my German by playing as much beach volleyball with my german friends as my knees allow;
- Studying [Isogeometric Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isogeometric_analysis) for [a project at TUM](/projects/softwarelab);
- Listening to a great deal of [Turma do Pagode](https://open.spotify.com/track/1Q9l8ZZGVrRhukejqitDtr?si=65001d1d569b4ec7) and [Zartmann](https://open.spotify.com/track/1prNhzt3DdgRoxKoALTEYo?si=6dd2272b14084e7d).

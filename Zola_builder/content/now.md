This is my [Now section](https://nownownow.com/about) and if you have your own website, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/) too!

Nowadays, I am:

- Studying for the third semester of my masters program at TUM;
- I'm currently also working on 2 simultaneous projects at TUM:
	- Using [Isogeometric Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isogeometric_analysis) for [a lightweight python implementation of contact modelling](/projects/softwarelab);
	- Using [Large-Eddy Simulations ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_eddy_simulation) for [the validation of SIGMA modelling of SGS stresses in MGLET](/projects/hydromechanicstum);
- Practicing the cavaquinho whenever I miss Brazil.
- Swimming, running, playing beach volleyball and padel as much as I can.
